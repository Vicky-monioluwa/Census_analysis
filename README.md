<h1>Mock Census Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In order to accurately allocate resources and conduct a comprehensive population survey of the country, the government of the United Kingdom traditionally commissions a census every ten years. In this project, a census of a medium-sized town wedged between two larger cities is examined. On a vacant piece of land, the local government is unsure what to invest in and what should be built. The procedures in this report will highlight the analysis I conducted to back up the offered recommendations. Employment trends, population growth, occupancy level, commuters, and an overview of the divorce and marriage rates are all subject to analysis.
<br />


<h2>Project Aim:</h2>
The aim of this project is to provide the local government with information to enable them make decisions about what to build and invest in on an existing plot of land based on the result of my analysis. To help with a high-level recommendation, the data has been explored and cleaned to remove any errors that can affect the analysis.

Overview of the Population: : In general, there are more female than male in the town <br/>

Age Pyramid: : From the age pyramid distribution, the town is not expanding. A low birth rate in the town is shown, which reveals that there are somewhat fewer young people than middle-aged people. <br/>

Count of Occupation groups: According to the visualisation below, more than half of the population are employed, indicating that, on average, its residents have a good paying job, and a large portion of its working population is thought to commute.. <br/>

<h2>Reccomendation</h2>
Given the higher number of commuters in the town, it is recommended that a train station be built in the town. This will make travel easier for university students and school children who will eventually have to travel to higher education institutions outside of the town because there is no university in the town. Because it is located between two larger cities, the town has a high employment rate. This will be a wise financial investment for the government that will greatly benefit the town's residents. A train station will make it easier and faster for higher education students as well as individuals who need to travel outside of the city for work.
Furthermore, given the town's high employment rate and low infirmity rate, there will be more retired elderly people in the future, necessitating the allocation of additional funds for end-of-life care. Because the town isn't growing, lodgers in the town are mostly single or divorced and there arenâ€™t any new families moving in, this should take precedence over education. 
In conclusion, low density housing could be advantageous for single-family homes or lodgers who need to downsize after a divorce. A train station will help more of the population because the town isn't experiencing population expansion.
